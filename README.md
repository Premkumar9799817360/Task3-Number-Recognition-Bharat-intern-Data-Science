## 🧠 Project Overview
The **Handwritten Digit Recognition System** is a deep learning-based project developed using the **MNIST dataset**.  
This model identifies digits (0–9) from scanned images of handwritten numbers using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built with **Keras**.

This task demonstrates a strong understanding of **neural networks, image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation** — a core skill in computer vision and AI.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a **Neural Network model** capable of recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset with high accuracy.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description – MNIST
The **MNIST dataset** consists of:
- **60,000 training images** and **10,000 testing images**
- Each image is **28x28 pixels**, grayscale (0–255 intensity)
- Labels correspond to digits **0–9**

It serves as a standard benchmark for handwritten digit recognition tasks in machine learning.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Loading
The MNIST dataset is loaded directly from the Keras library.

```python
from keras.datasets import mnist

(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
X_train, y_train → Training data and labels

X_test, y_test → Testing data and labels
```

### 2️⃣ Importing Libraries
```python
# Importing essential libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
from keras.datasets import mnist
import keras
```
These libraries are used for:

Data handling: NumPy, Pandas

Visualization: Matplotlib

Deep learning: Keras

### 3️⃣ Model Compilation
```python 
# Model compilation
model.compile(
    loss='categorical_crossentropy',
    optimizer=RMSprop(),
    metrics=["accuracy"]
)
```
Loss Function: categorical_crossentropy — used for multi-class classification

Optimizer: RMSprop() — optimizes gradient descent

Metric: Accuracy

### 4️⃣ Model Training
```python 
# Training input/output variables, batch size, epochs
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    batch_size=batch_size,
    epochs=epochs,
    verbose=2
)
```
The model is trained over defined epochs using the given batch size.

Training continues until convergence with minimal loss and high accuracy.

### 5️⃣ Model Evaluation
Test Accuracy: 96.45%
The model achieves an impressive 96.45% accuracy on unseen test data.
---

### 6️⃣ Model Performance Summary

Test loss: 0.1343
Test accuracy: 0.9645
This demonstrates the model’s excellent generalization ability on new handwritten digit images.

### 7️⃣ Saving the Model
```PYTHON 
# Save model and architecture to single file
model.save('MNIST-ANN.h5')
model.summary()
print("Saved model")
The trained model and its architecture are saved as a single .h5 file for future reuse or deployment.
```
## 📈 Model Summary
